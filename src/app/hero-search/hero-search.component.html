  <ul class="search-result">
    <!--
AsyncPipe:
As expected, the *ngFor repeats hero objects.
Look closely and you'll see that the *ngFor iterates over a list called heroes$, not heroes.-->
   <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes$ | async" >
      <!--
The $ is a convention that indicates heroes$ is an Observable, not an array.
The *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable. But there's also a pipe character (|) followed by async, which identifies Angular's AsyncPipe.
The AsyncPipe subscribes to an Observable automatically so you won't have to do so in the component class.
